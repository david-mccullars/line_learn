FRED: I like to go west.
MARTHA:  Yes.
FRED:  It's clever.
BILL:  What do you guys want to do for dinner?
MARTHA: Not sure.
FRED:  How about we dine out?
BILL:  Can we afford it?
FRED: I think so.
MARTHA:  There's a new place on Smith St.
MARTHA:  But that's Italian, and I know you don't like Italian.
FRED:  It depends.
BILL:  What does that mean?
FRED:  I've had it before where I liked it -- well, maybe that was Greek.  I'm not sure.
FRED:  Let's just eat BBQ, okay?
BILL:  Okay.
